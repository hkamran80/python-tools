# Python Tools
Tools built with Python! Helping you throughout your day.

# App Name, Python Version, Dependencies
  - `ip-address`: Python 3 (requires dependencies)
  - `weather`: Python 2 (no dependencies)
  - `folder_destroyer`: Python 3 (no dependencies)
  - `internet_connection_test`: Python 2/3 (no dependencies)
  - `timecalc`: Python 2/3 (no dependencies)
  - `macscan`: Python 3 (untested with 2, one dependency: `requests`--not required)


# App Notes
*`internet_connection_test`: 
  - The `sudo reboot` function works on Linux and macOS only!
* `netscan`:
  - `arp -n {IP_ADDRESS}` is UNIX-specific, probably works on Windows's Command Prompt, but I doubt it.
  - Can a Windows user email/[tweet](https://twitter.com/hkamran80) me whether `ping -t 2 {IP_ADDRESS` works?
